<h2>My top 3 best movies for kids</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Angry Birds 2</h3>
<p>I love angry Birds 2 becuse it is not only great for the kids, but for the whole family.<br />
It displays friendship, humour and a bit of romance. It's a great watch!</p>
<h3>Frozen 2</h3>
<p>Frozen 2 is just the best. It has some comedy scenes, romance and also fantasy, mystery vibes.</p>
<h3>Enchanted</h3>
<p>Enchanted is a sweet movie that once again is great not only for the kids, but also for the whole family.</p>
